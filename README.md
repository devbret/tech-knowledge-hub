Tech Knowledge Hub is a digital glossary and resource archive curated by Bret Bernhoft, designed to organize and share key ideas, terminology and references across technology, science and digital culture.

It provides concise definitions for a wide range of subjects reflecting a desire to understand modern technology’s impact on society and human capability. Each glossary term is paired with relevant tags, enabling visitors to filter, explore, and learn interactively through a simple search and navigation interface.

In addition to its glossary, the site functions as a living library of resources, linking to open-source projects, educational platforms, communities and influential organizations. These curated resources span areas such as AI development, digital privacy, open hardware and creative commons culture, connecting users to meaningful tools and knowledge hubs on the web.

By blending conceptual understanding with practical references, Tech Knowledge Hub serves as both a personal knowledge base and a public learning portal for anyone seeking to explore the evolving landscape of technology and human augmentation.
